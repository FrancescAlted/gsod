# Organization Profile

## Your details

### Previous Experience with Technical writers or Documentation

NumFOCUS is a umbrella organization for many open source research projects. All our projects have documentation at various levels of
quality. Some projects like [QuTiP](http://qutip.org/docs/latest/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) have
execellent documentation and tutorials. We strive to continusly improve our documentation and participate in documentation events as well as organise them in the past. The Shogun project has participated in 2012 GSoC Doc Camp. The pandas project has organized 
documentation [sprints](https://python-sprints.github.io/pandas/). To our knowledge none of the projects participating under the
NumFOCUS umbrella have previous experience with technical writer. 

### Previous Experience with GSoC and Similar Programs

NumFOCUS has participated in GSoC since 2015 and is actively participating this year again. We have successfully mentored more then 50
students in that time. Due to the scientific nature of most NumFOCUS sponsered projects many contributors have an academic brackground
and are used to mentor students from a BSc to a PhD level and are experienced in writing for scientific journals and grand proposals. 
We are confident that we can provide excellent support for the technical writers and are looking forward to working with them.
