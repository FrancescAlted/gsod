__Project name:__ Matplotlib for Data Scientists

__Description:__ Matplotlib was primarily develped by scientists for scientific visualization, and modeled on scientific computation languages such as Matlab, but one of the fastest growing audiences for Matplotlib is data science practitioners. To address the needs of this audience, we propose developing a conceptual overview (such as the scikit one linked below) oriented at newcomers to scientific visualization. 

The overview would possibly cover topics such as:
* the visualization pipeline: data->transformation->chart
* matplotlib's role in the viz pipeline , i.e. that it's a low level library
* assumptions matplotlib makes about the structure of the data, user, and task
* the relationship between matplotlib and libaries built on top, such as Pandas and Seaborn
* matplotlib's imperative architecture and how that differs from declarative libraries like ggplot

Either the overview could cover these topics, or they could possibly make for good cheatsheets:
* terminology that can be confusing or is used inconsistently (ex norm and colormap on images, tickers/locators)
* how to customize the plots created by libraries like Pandas and Seaborn

These topics and scope are expected to change as the overview develops and we welcome suggestions by the technical writer on approaches for addressing this audience.
